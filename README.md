# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detectection
Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. This project aims to detect and predict the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy using a deep learning model. The dataset used is from Kaggle (tanlikesmath/diabetic-retinopathy-resized), and we train the model using EfficientNetB0 in Google Colab.
